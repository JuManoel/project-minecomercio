Hello World
This project was made when I was in UCaldas University, in second Semester, subject: Prog2
The main idea of this project is creat a System to manager a little shop, using OOP techniques, and a bit of Front End.
My professor was Carlos Cuesta (very good professor), and this is my final project for his subject.
In the current date (Abril~May 2024) I still working in it.
comercioporf is the back-end. The files insid it are just Java, class to test the Model, Service, Helpers class.
There is also Data, with json files, and peticiones.http.
the name of the folder (comercioprof) is because Carlos Cuesta send to us the bases of this project.
